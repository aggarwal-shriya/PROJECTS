# Programming Repository

A clean collection of programs I write while learning, practicing, and improving my coding skills. Nothing fancy—just consistent work, better logic, and steady progress.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal log of the concepts I learn. Every file here reflects something I practiced, tested, or revisited. Over time, it should show how my coding style and problem‑solving evolve.

## What’s Inside

* Small programs written while learning new topics
* Practice problems and logic-building exercises
* Occasional mini‑projects when I feel inspired

## Languages & Tools

* Python
* Git & GitHub
* VS Code

## Notes

Most programs are simple by design—this repo is about getting better, not pretending to be perfect. I keep things readable and straightforward, and I update old code as I improve.

## Contributions

This is a personal learning repository, but if you spot something that can be improved, feel free to open an issue.

Thanks for visiting.
